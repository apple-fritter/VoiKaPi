## Flowchart:

1. Assemble hardware
2. Install Ubuntu Mate on Raspberry Pi
3. Install required software packages
4. Configure GPU for use with Raspberry Pi
5. Install OpenFace library
6. Test the microexpression detection system
7. Use the system to detect microexpressions offline

## Step-by-step guide:

### Assemble hardware:

- Connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
- Attach the GPU to the Raspberry Pi using a compatible interface such as USB or Thunderbolt.
- Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi.
- Install Ubuntu Mate on Raspberry Pi:

### Download the `Ubuntu Mate` operating system image from the [official website](https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/).
- Write the image to a MicroSD card using a tool such as `BalenaEtcher`.
- Insert the MicroSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
- Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
- Install required software packages:

Open a terminal window and run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib
```

These commands will install `OpenCV`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Matplotlib` on the Raspberry Pi.

### Configure GPU for use with Raspberry Pi:

Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install any necessary drivers or software for the GPU.
Open a terminal window and run the following commands to install the necessary software for using the GPU with the Raspberry Pi:
```arduino
sudo apt-get install libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libx11-dev mesa-utils
sudo apt-get install mesa-opencl-icd ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```

Reboot the Raspberry Pi.
### Install OpenFace library:

Open a terminal window and run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libdc1394-22-dev
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace.git
cd OpenFace
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
```

This will download and install the OpenFace library on the Raspberry Pi.

### Test the microexpression detection system:

Write a Python script to capture video from the camera and analyze it for microexpressions using OpenCV and the pre-trained models provided by the OpenFace library.
Run the script and verify that the microexpression detection system is working correctly.

### Use the system to detect microexpressions offline:

Once the microexpression detection system is working correctly, you can use it to detect microexpressions offline without an internet connection.
For example, you could use the system to analyze video recordings of social interactions and identify patterns in facial expressions. Keep in mind that this is just a general guide, and you may need to modify the steps based on your specific hardware and software configuration. However, following these steps should give you a good starting point for building your own offline microexpression detection device using the OpenFace library.
